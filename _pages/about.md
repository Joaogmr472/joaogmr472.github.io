About Me
===
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Atmospheric Sciences from the Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI), Brazil (2015–2020), where I developed a strong foundation in meteorology, climate dynamics, and environmental analysis. I then pursued my Master's degree in Environment and Water Resources (2021–2023) at UNIFEI, during which my research focused on lightning physics and mesoscale convective systems over southerneast Brazil. In the end of my masters, I started the evaluation the impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) on extreme precipitation associated with extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. This work involved the use of climate model projections to assess how potential geoengineering interventions could affect storm dynamics and regional hydrology.

I am currently completing my PhD at UNIFEI in the Climate and Sustainability program. My doctoral research extends this line of investigation by analyzing large-scale circulation patterns and future climate scenarios to better understand how climate interventions and warming pathways influence extreme weather, atmospheric dynamics, and hydrological extremes in the Southern Hemisphere.

Throughout my academic career, I have also participated in several P&D (Research and Development) projects focused on climate risk assessment, hydrological modeling, and the development of decision-support tools for sustainable energy and water management in Brazil. These projects have strengthened my skills in interdisciplinary collaboration, data analysis, and applied climate research.

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on understanding large-scale climate change, extreme weather events, and their interactions with climate interventions and mitigation pathways. I have a particular interest in:

- Detection and attribution of large-scale climate change;

- The dynamics and impacts of extreme events, such as extratropical cyclones;

- Pathways to climate stabilization and runaway scenarios;

- Impacts of geoengineering, uncertainties, and risk assessment;

- Application of climate models, statistical methods, and data visualization tools to support evidence-based decision-making.

Ethical Statement
======
Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) is a naturally controversial topic. As a researcher, I constantly reflect on the ethics of studying and, one day, perhaps using this technology. What motivates me is the slow progress in reducing emissions and the political difficulties in creating effective climate laws. My intention, however, is not to advocate for the use of SAI. My goal is to critically analyze the costs, uncertainties, and risks of these climate intervention techniques. In this way, in the future, those responsible for these decisions will be able to do so transparently, based on the best available science.
